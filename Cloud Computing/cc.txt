cloud based data storage
Cloud-based data storage refers to the practice of storing and managing data
in remote servers that are accessible via the internet. Instead of storing data
on local hardware devices like hard drives or on-premises servers,
cloud storage allows individuals and businesses to store their data
in off-site data centers owned and maintained by cloud service providers.
